With IaC we are not just automating a process through a code, we are also documenting it. This code can be checked into version control to get versioning providing a history of who changed what and how the infrastructure was defined at any given time. Last but not least, same as with programming code, we can reuse the developed infrastructure code in other projects or infrastructure, improving our process and getting results faster."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"There are multiple tools to do IaC, one of them is Terraform by HashiCorp.
