With IaC we are not just automating a process through a code, we are also documenting it. This code can be checked into version control to get versioning providing a history of who changed what and how the infrastructure was defined at any given time. Last but not least, same as with programming code, we can reuse the developed infrastructure code in other projects or infrastructure, improving our process and getting results faster.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are multiple tools to do IaC, one of them is Terraform by HashiCorp. IBM Cloud offers Schematics: a simplified solution for provisioning and orchestrating infrastructure supported by the Terraform engine. This is a fully open Terraform service, so you can create and execute templates native to your organization’s hybrid cloud environment. Terraform and Schematics leverage your best practices to save time and money, while increasing performance.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In summary, Infrastructure as Code reduces costs, speeds delivery execution, and reduces risk by documenting and managing infrastructure using the same tools used in software engineering to document, version, and manage code. In this Infrastructure as Code pattern we’ll cover both Terraform and IBM Cloud Schematics.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
