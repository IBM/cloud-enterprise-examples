The majority of them have a significant number of legacy monolithic applications running in WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (WAS ND) on traditional IT.

Now the customer would like to host the application in a cloud environment, but they have no desire to make any code changes to move the apps. While it might be beneficial for the customer to invest money in rethinking and redesigning their entire portfolio of applications as part of moving off of traditional WebSphere, in reality this is overkill for applications that still provide the proper business functionality just fine and require little maintenance for bug fixes or new features. For these legacy monoliths, we can reduce the maintenance overhead by moving the apps as-is to run in WebSphere Liberty on Red Hat OpenShift.
