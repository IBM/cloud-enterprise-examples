Before you jump straight into Cloud native development using this crafted enablement journey. Its important you understand the basic concepts and developer tasks when working with Kubernetes or OpenShift. The following **Pre Learning** activities are highly encouraged to be completed if you have never seen or used a Kubernetes cluster for development before.

[Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) is an interactive learning and training platform for software developers. Each student is given access to a new environment without the need to install all the required component by themselves.

The pre learning is broken into three areas:
-  **Cloud Native Deployment** approach **Cloud**, **12 Factor Applications** and **Cloud Native Development**.
-  **Cloud Native Development** deployment using **Katacoda's**
-  **RedHat OpenShift Learning Katacoda's** to help you get familiar with the OpenShift platform and tools

Complete the **Katacoda's** and read the background material before moving onto using the **IBM GSI Sandbox** agenda.
