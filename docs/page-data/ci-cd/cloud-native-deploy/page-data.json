The instructions below\nwill show you how to do it.\n\nYou can create a new app using one of the [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/codepatterns/overview). These have been \ncreated to include all the key components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you \nneed for your solutions. The approach for getting started is exactly the same for an environment based on \n**Kubernetes** or **Red Hat OpenShift**.\n\n**Note:** The instructions provided below lean heavily on the use of the <Globals name=\"igccli\"/> to both show how the\nCLI works in context and to streamline the process (the reason for creating the CLI in the first place). However, the \nuse of the CLI is in no way required to use the <Globals name=\"shortName\"/>. If you would prefer to work through these \ninstructions without the use of the CLI, we have provided the equivalent manual steps for each command on \nthe [Cloud Native Toolkit CLI](/getting-started/cli) page.\n\nThis video demonstrates how to work through the steps to create an application and use a deployment pipeline to install\nit into your development cluster.\n\n<Video src=\"/videos/deployapp.m4v\" type=\"video/m4v\" poster=\"/images/poster.png\"/>\n\n### Links\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"#1.-log-into-your-development-cluster-from-the-command-line\">1.

Log into your Development Cluster from the command line\n\n1. Make sure you have installed all [Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs) before continuing\n2. Open a terminal\n3. Log in to the development cluster's CLI (Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift)\n\n    To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud console_, click on the **Access** tab, and follow the \n    instructions to log in to the cluster from the command line\n    \n4. You can test that you're connected to the cluster with the following simple command:\n\n  ```shell script\n  kubectl get pods -n tools\n  ```\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"info\">\n\n**Note:** Most all of the remaining steps assume this step has already been performed. If you stop and then come\nback later it is a good idea to re-run this step again before proceeding\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### 2. Create the development namespace\n\nBefore getting started, the development namespace/project needs to be created and prepared for the DevOps pipelines.\nThis is something that would typically happen once at the beginning of a project as a development team is \nformed and assigned to the cluster.\n\n```shell script\nigc sync {DEV_NAMESPACE} --dev\n```\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"info\">\n\n**Note:** Previously when using OpenShift, it was required to run `oc new-project {namespace}` first. That extra\nstep is no longer required with version 0.5.1 of the CLI or greater.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### 3. Open the Developer Dashboard\n\nThe [Developer Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard) makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a \nsection that allows you to select a set of preconfigured [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/codepatterns/overview) that \nmake seeding your development project very easy.\n\n1. Open a browser and make sure you are logged into [Github](https://github.com)\n2. Open the dashboard by running the following command:\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc dashboard\n    ```\n\n### 4. Create your app in Git\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** If you are developing on a shared education cluster, you need to make it easy to identify \nyour app. Please suffix the app name with your initials `{app name}-{your initials}` (e.g.\n`stockbffnode-mjp`) and use the **Git Organization** for the shared environment.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** Your browser needs to be logged in to your GitHub account for a template to work. If the link from the \ntile displays the GitHub 404 page, log in and reload the page.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\n1. From the Developer Dashboard, click on **<Globals name=\"templates\" />** tab\n\n2. Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for your application and the language and framework that \nyou prefer to work with.\n\n  Click on a <Globals name=\"template\" /> **Tile** to create your app github repository from the \n    template repository selected. You can also click on the **Git Icon** to browse the source template \n    repository and click on the **Template** to create the template\n    \n3. Complete the [GitHub create repository from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) \nprocess.\n\n  **Owner**: Select a validate GitHub organization that you are authorized to create repositories within or the one you were given for the shared cluster (See warning above)\n\n  **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo, GitHub will help with showing a green tick if it is valid (See warning above)\n\n  **Description**: Describe your app\n\n  Press **Create repository from template**\n\n  ![Template](/images/template.png)\n\nThe new repository will be created in your selected organization.\n\n### 5. Clone your code\n\n1. Next, clone it to your local machine.\n2. Click on **Clone or download**\n3. Copy the clone _SSH link_, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.\n    ```shell script\n    git clone git@github.com:bwoolf1/stockbffnode.git\n    ```\n4. Change into the cloned directory\n    ```shell script\n    cd stockbffnode\n    ```\n\n### 6. Run the application locally\n\nMost developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions \nlisted in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. You may be required to install a specific runtime \nlike **Java**, **Node**, or **Python**.\n\n### 7. Set the namespace context\n\nBefore running these remainder of the instructions commands it is important to set the \nnamespace/project context. (**Notes:** The `kubernetes` command will work for both `openshift` \nand `kubernetes`.)\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n```shell script\noc project {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n```\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n```shell script\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace={DEV_NAMESPACE}\n```\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### 8. Register the App in a DevOps Pipeline\n\nUp to this point you have the code in a GitHub repository and have cloned it to you local development environment. You \nnow need to register the repository with the continuous integration pipeline. The <Globals name=\"env\" /> supports both \n[Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton) and [Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration) for continuous \nintegration.\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"info\">\n\nThe pipeline command give an option for both `Jenkins` and `Tekton`. For more information about working with the \ndifferent build engines, please see [Continuous Integration with Jenkins Guide](/guides/continuous-integration) and\n[Continuous Integration with Tekton Guide](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n1. Start the process to create a pipeline\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc pipeline\n    ```\n\n2. The first time a pipeline is registered in the namespace, the CLI will ask for a username and \n**Personal Access Token** for the Git repository that will be stored in a secret named `git-credentials`. It will\nalso ask for the branch that should be used for the pipeline. \n\n  **Username**: Enter your GitHub user id\n  \n  **Personal Access Token**: Paste your GitHub personal access token\n  \n  **Branch**: Press enter for the default git branch or type in another branch you want to register\n\n3. When registering a `Tekton` pipeline, you will also be prompted to select which pipeline you want to use for your \napplication\n\n4. When registering a `Jenkins` pipeline, the CLI will also set up a webhook with the git host\n\n    **Note:** if the webhook registration step fails it is likely because the Git credentials are incorrect or do\n    not have enough permission in the repository\n\nThe pipeline will be registered in your development cluster.\n\n### 9. View your application pipeline\n\nThe steps to view your registered pipeline will vary based on type of pipeline (`Jenkins` or `Tekton`) and container\nplatform version (`IKS`, `OCP 3.11`, or `OCP 4.3`).\n\n<Accordion>\n<AccordionItem title=\"Jenkins\">\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3\">\n\n1.

Access the running app\n\nOnce the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the namespace used when \nregistering the pipeline. To validate the app is running follow these steps:\n\n**Note:** Be sure the namespace context is set correctly before running the following commands -\n[set the manspace context](#7.-set-the-namespace-context)\n\n1. Retrieve the app ingress endpoint using commands below in your terminal.\n\n    ```bash\n    igc endpoints \n    ```\n  \n2. From the endpoints listed, select the URL for the repo that was just deployed and press **Enter** to \nopen that URL in a web browser and validate the application is working as expected\n\n### 11. Locate the app in the web console\n\nThe build pipeline is configured to build the source code from the Git repository into a container image. This\nimage is stored in the [Image Registry](/guides/image-registry). After that the image is deployed into the \nsame namespace/project within development cluster where the pipeline ran and validated for its health.

From the endpoints listed, select the URL for the repo that was just deployed and press **Enter** to \nopen that URL in a web browser and validate the application is working as expected\n\n### 11. Locate the app in the web console\n\nThe build pipeline is configured to build the source code from the Git repository into a container image. This\nimage is stored in the [Image Registry](/guides/image-registry). After that the image is deployed into the \nsame namespace/project within development cluster where the pipeline ran and validated for its health. The steps \nbelow will walk through locating the installed application within the Web Console.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3\">\n\n1. Open the **OpenShift web console**\n2. Change to the **Developer** view\n3. Click on **Topology** menu\n4. Click on your application deployment in the topology view\n5. Click on on the **Overview** tab\n6. Increase the number of running pods\n7. Click **Resource** tab and then on the pod **View Logs** link\n8. You can see the running state of your application\n\n![Pods on OpenShift](images/topology.png)\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 3.11\">\n\n1. Open the **OpenShift web console**\n2. Change to the **Application Console**\n3. Select you project either `dev` or the namespace you used to deploy your app\n4. Click on **Deployments**\n5. You should see the deployment of your application\n6. Click on your application, and the corresponding deployment number\n7. Try increasing the number of pods to see new instances being provisioned\n8. Click on one of the `pod` instances\n9. Click on **Logs**\n10. You can see the running state of your application\n11. Navigate around the console to understand where your deployment, service and pods are running\n\n![Pods on OpenShift](images/podsos.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n1. Open the **Kubernetes Dashboard**\n2. Change to the namespace from `default` to either `dev` or the namespace you used to deploy your app\n3. Click on **Deployments**\n4. You should see the deployment of your application\n5. Click on your application , and the corresponding **Replica Set**\n6. Try scaling the application, click on **Scale** in the header, change number of pods to 2 and click **OK**\n7. Click on one of the `pod` instances\n8. Click on **Logs**\n9. You can see the running state of your application\n10. Navigate around the console to understand where your deployment, service and pods are running\n\n![Pods on IKS](images/podsiks.png)\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"success\">\n\n**Success:** You should now have your application running inside your development cluster.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nHaving reached this point, we recommend you repeat the process a few more times using different code \npattern templates and explore the environment to get familiar with it. For more information about the \ntools used by the pipeline, check out the [Guides](/guides/overview)\n\nThis completes the deployment of your app. The next step is to prepare for Continuous Delivery, Code \nAnalysis, and Artifact Management.\n\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/johandry/Workspace/ibm/att-cloudnative/ibmcloud-pattern-guide/src/pages/ci-cd/cloud-native-deploy/index.mdx"}}}}
