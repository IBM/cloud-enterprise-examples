In the below screenshot you can see stages for **Build**, **Containerize**, and **Deploy**. \nTo add more stages to represent **Test** for example, click the **Add Stage** button to add and configure a new stage.\n\n![pipeline stages](../../../images/cicd-toolchain-stages.png)  \n\nWhen creating a new stage, you specify the **Input** data, the **Jobs** (or scripts) that will execute on that input, and where these scripts will run by specifying **Workers**. \nJobs scripts can be reference from a source control repository, and configured using teh **Environment properties** tab. \nYou can include several Jobs in a stage. Jobs run sequentially in a stage, and each job runs in a clean container environment.\n \n![pipeline new stage](../../../images/cicd-toolchain-newstage.png)  \n\nEach job is designed to be able to \"fail fast\"- to stop the pipeline on error. \n\n\n![pipeline fail fast](../../../images/cicd-pipeline-failfast.png)  \n\n\n## Adding Test Execution\n\nWith the current stages, it is easy to add a test stage to run unit tests, functional tests, or to integrate with a static anaylsis tool such as SonarQuber.\nThe IBM Cloud toolchain provides flexible mechanisms through Jobs and Stages to easily add the integrations to the tools you need to use.\n\nOnce testing tool that is provided native on IBM Cloud to help multiple testing scnearios is Devops Insights.\nIBM Cloud DevOps Insights is a tool that aggregates code, test, build, and deployment data to provide visibility of quality for all of your teams.\nWith DevOps Insights, you can maintain and improve the quality of your code in IBM Cloud™. \nYou can monitor your deployments to identify risks before they are released, analyze development changes for error probability, and improve the interactions of your team.\n\nFollow [this tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-di_working) for a detailed step by step tutorial to add devops insights into your pipeline.\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"15df86cc39ce74a5d599b8f4798d03dc","counter":634,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IBM Cloud Toolchain SDLC","description":"IBM Cloud Toolchain SDLC","keywords":"ibm cloud cicd"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: IBM Cloud Toolchain SDLC\ndescription: IBM Cloud Toolchain SDLC\nkeywords: 'ibm cloud cicd'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nIBM Cloud Toolchain SDLC\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink>SDLC</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Adding Test Execution</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n\n## SDLC   \nThe IBM Cloud Toolchain breaks down different SDLC steps into different stages.
