Perform the following steps below to complete this task:\n1. Navigate on the IBM Cloud dashboard to the manage link at the top and choose  Access (IAM), and select Access Groups, shown below\n\n![Access IAM](./images/iam.png \"Acess IAM\")\n\n2. Click Create\n3. Enter a name and optional description for your group, and click Create.\n\n![Create Group](./images/create.png \"Create Group\")\n\nThe new IAM access group has now been created, similar to the view below\n![Add users](./images/created.png \"Add Users to the Group\")\n\n\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n##### Note: \nYou can delete a group by selecting the Remove group option. When you remove a group from the account, you are removing all users and service IDs from the group and all access that is assigned to the group.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Creating an Access Group using CLI\n\nyou can use the ibmcloud iam access-group-create command.\n```bash\nibmcloud iam access-group-create GROUP_NAME [-d, --description DESCRIPTION]\n```\n\n\nTo create an access group policy by using the CLI, you can use the ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create command.\n\n```bash\nibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create GROUP_NAME {-f, --file @JSON_FILE | --roles ROLE_NAME1,ROLE_NAME2... [--service-name SERVICE_NAME] [--service-instance SERVICE_INSTANCE] [--region REGION] [--resource-type RESOURCE_TYPE] [--resource RESOURCE] [--resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID]}\n```\n## Setting up Access Group Permissions\nSo now that we have setup a new access group, let's go and add permissions for viewing event logs. \nYou can assign the policy by using the UI or through the command line.\n\nWhen you define the policy, you need to select a platform role and a service role:\n\n<li> Platform management roles cover a range of actions, including the ability to create and delete instances, manage aliases, bindings, and credentials, and manage access. The platform roles are administrator, editor, operator, viewer. Platform management roles also apply to account management services that enable users to invite users, manage service IDs, access policies, catalog entries, and track billing and usage depending on their assigned role on an account management service.</li>\n\n<li> Service access roles define a user or service’s ability to perform actions on a service instance. The service access roles are manager, writer, and reader.</li>\n\nFor users to manage Activity Tracker with LogDNA, the following roles must be assigned, Platform role: **Viewer** and Service role: **Reader**.\nFor more on managing access for IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA, visit [Learn More](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-iam#iam)\n\nTo assign a policy to an access group through the UI, complete the following:\n<li> From the menu bar, click Manage > Access (IAM), and select Access Groups.</li>\n\n<li>Select the name of the group that you want to assign access to.</li>\n\n#### The Access groups selected shown below\n![Select Access Group](./images/accessgroup.png \"Select Access Group\")\n#### Click the Assign access tab shown in the screenshot below\n![Access Policy](./images/policy.png \"Access Policy\")\n#### Assign your Access group additional permissions page, seen in the screenshot below\n![Assign Permissions](./images/assign.png \"Assign Permissions\")\nGrant permissions (We need to provide permissions to our Access group).\n\n#### Option one, grant permission on the service\n1. Select Assign access to resources.\n2. Select IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA.\n3. Select Resource Group\n4. Select All current regions.\n5. Select All current service instances.\n6.

Click Add users on the Users tab.\n\n#### Select the Add users tab shown below\n![Add Users](./images/addusers.png \"Add Users to Group\")\n\nA list of users will show up, select the user(s) that you want to add from the list, and click Add users.\n\nThe user was successfully added to the Access group shown below\n![User Successfully Added](./images/useradded.png \"User Successfully\")\n\n## Adding a Service Account to the access group\n\nFollow the steps below.\n1. From the menu bar, click Manage > Access (IAM), and select Access Groups.\n2. Select the name of the group that you want to assign access to.\n3. Click the Service IDs tab, and click Add service ID.\n\n#### Service ID tab, shown in the screenshot below\n![Service ID](./images/serviceid.png \" Service ID Tab\")\n\nA list of Servie IDs will show, select the IDs you want to add and click Add service ID.\n\n#### Screenshot below, showing a Service ID successfully added to the Access group\n![Service ID Added](./images/serviceidadded.png \"Service ID Added\")\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nFor more information on controlling event log access, see [Managing Access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-iam) and [Granting Permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-iam_view_events).\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Granting permissions for event logs\n\n#### Granting permissions to manage logs and configure alerts\n\nAs an admin user in LogDNA, you must have permissions to run the following actions:\n\n* Add LogDNA log sources\n* View logs\n* Search logs\n* Filter logs\n* Configure alerts\n\n**For more information, see ** [Granting permissions to manage logs and configure alerts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-work_iam#admin_user_logdna)\n\nFrom the IBM Cloud menu bar, click Manage > Access (IAM), and then select Users and click on the user account you wish to manage, similar to the screen shown below. \n\n![Select the User](./images/assignaccessuser2.png)\n\nNext, choose the **Access polices** tab, similar to the screenshot below. \n\n\n![Users Access Tab](./images/direct_access_user1.png \"Users Access Tab\")\n\nClick on the Assign access button, similar to the page shown below. \n\n![Assign Access](./images/direct_access_user.png \"Assign Access\")\n\nYou're then taken to the **Assign access** page for the user, similar to the screen shown below. \n\n\n![User Assign Access](./images/direct_access_user2a.png \"User Assign Access\")\n\nOn the drop down menu for:  **What type of access do you want to assign**, choose IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA.
