You can also define multiple notification channels for an alert. Alerts can be muted or you can detach alerts. For example, you can configure an alert that is triggered after 30 seconds, or when a 100 log lines that match the view's filtering and search criteria are collected.\n\n\nTo find out more, see [Working with Alerts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-alerts)\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink>Configuring Event Log Alerts Notifications</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Testing Alerts</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Configure a view-specific alert</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Delete a preset (alert template)</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Detach a view-specific alert from a view</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Configuring Event Log Alerts Notifications\n\n\n\n\nAlerts can be configured for multiple notification channels. The following valid channels are supported: email, Slack, PagerDuty, Webhook\nYou can also define a preset. A preset is an alert template that you can attach to any number of views.\n\nLets get started in configuring an alert preset (alert template). \n\nLog in to your IBM Cloud account External link icon.\nFrom the Menu icon, select Observability.\nSelect Logging. The list of IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service instances that are available on IBM Cloud is displayed.\nSelect one instance and click View LogDNA.\n\n![LogDNA Instances](./images/logdnainstances.png \"LogDNA Instance\")\n\nThe LogDNA dashboard opens, shown below.\n![LogDNA Dashboard](./images/dashboard.png \"LogDNA Dashboard View\")\n\n\n#### Complete the following steps to configure a preset:\n\n1. Select the Settings icon. ![Settings Icon](./images/configicon.png \"Settings Icon\")\n2. Select Alerts.\n3. Select Add a preset alert.\n4. Choose a notification channel.\n5. Define the threshold conditions.\n\n a. Select a time frequency. For example, 12 hours.\n\n b. Enter the number of log lines after which you want the alert to trigger.\n\n c. Select whether you want both conditions to be checked or just one.\n\nAdd the details for the notification channel that you have chosen.\n\nFor example, for the email notification channel, add one or more recipients, and optionally a time zone.\n![Predefined Alert](./images/predefinedalert.png \" Predefined Alert\")\n\n## Testing Alerts\n\nPerform a test to see if the alert notification is successful. \nIf so, click Save alert.\n![Test Notification](./images/testalert.png \"Test Notification\")\n\nNow, let's adjust the alert notification time from 12 hours (as configured above) to one minute to see if any alerts notications come through. \n\nThe screenshot below was captured to show the number of event logs matching the preset view alerts.\n\n![Alert Notification](./images/alertsmatch.png \"Alert Notification\")\n\n\n\n## Configure a view-specific alert\n\n1. Click the Views icon Configuration icon. ![Configuration Icon](./images/configicon.png)\n   Create a view.\n\n2. Apply a time frame, filters and search criteria to filter the log lines that are displayed through the view.\n\n3. For more information, see [Creating Views](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-view_logs#view_logs_step7)\n\n4. Click the view name. Then, select Attach an alert.\n\n5. Choose view-specific alert.\n\n6. Choose a notification channel.\n\n7. Define the threshold conditions.\n\n8. Select a time frequency. For example, 12 hours.\n\n9. Enter the number of log lines after which you want the alert to trigger.\n\n9. Select whether you want both conditions to be checked or just one.\n\n10. Add the details for the notification channel that you have chosen.\n\nFor example, for the email notification channel, add one or more recipients, and optionally a time zone.\n\nClick Save alert.\n\nFor more information on configuring alerts see, [Creating Views](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-view_logs#view_logs_step7)\n\n## Delete a preset (alert template)\nComplete the following steps to delete a preset:\n\n1. Select the Configuration icon.\n![Configuration Icon](./images/configicon.png)\nSelect Alerts.\n2. Hover the mouse over the edit button of the preset that you want to delete. The delete option shows.\n3. Select Delete.\n5. Confirm that you want to delete the preset. Click Delete.\n\n## Detach a view-specific alert from a view\nComplete the following steps to detach a preset:\n\n1. Select the Configuration icon Configuration icon.\n![Configuration Icon](./images/configicon.png)\nSelect Alerts.\n2. over the mouse over the edit button of the alert that you want to delete. The delete option shows.\n3. Select Detach.\n4. Confirm that you want to delete the alert.
