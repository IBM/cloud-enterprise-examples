As a certified Kubernetes provider, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management for your apps.\n\n## IKS on VPC\n\nTo understand the sample cluster architectures and the components that are created in an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service VPC cluster architecture, kindly refer this [link](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch#architecture_vpc).\nIt describes the default components that are setup and how they interact with each other. \n\n<!--\nThe following diagram describes the default components that are set up in an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service VPC cluster architecture.\n\n![Architecture](./images/architecture.png \"IKS on VPC\") \n*Source:[IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch)*\n-->\n## Auto scaling of IKS\n\nAutomatic scaling in Kubernetes comes in two forms:\n\n  - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** scales the pods in a deployment or replica set. It is autoscaling at pod level. \n  \n  ![Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](./images/hpa.png) \n\n  It is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each HorizontalPodAutoscaler definition. For more details, please refer [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/).\n\n  - **Cluster Autoscaler (CA)** is the Kubernetes component that can be used to perform scaling nodes in a cluster. It periodically scans the cluster to adjust the number of worker nodes within the worker pools for pending pods to scales-up and to scale down underutilized worker nodes.
