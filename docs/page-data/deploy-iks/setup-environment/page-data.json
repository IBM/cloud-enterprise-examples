Make sure to attach a public gateway to your subnet so that you can access public endpoints from your cluster.\n\nCreate a standard VPC Generation 2 compute cluster by using the IBM Cloud console. For more detailed information, please refer \n[here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console). \n\nOnce VPC is created, you need to edit the default security group to allow incoming network traffic from the VPC load balancers. Follow the steps given [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-firewall#security_groups_ui)\nfor opening security group ports via console. \nAfter editing, the Default Security Group of your VPC will show Inbound rules as shown in snapshot below.\n\n![Security Group](./images/vpc-security-group.png) \n\n## Create IKS on VPC Infrastructure\n\nFollow the instructions given [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started#vpc-classic-gs) and create an IKS instance on VPC. For this pattern, we have created IKS which has worker pool (2vCPU and 4GB RAM) with one worker node. Once created, wait for some time (~40 minutes) for the cluster to get ready. \n\n## Install the IBM Cloud CLI and plug-ins\n\nIt includes the installation of these CLIs and plug-ins:\n\n  1. IBM Cloud CLI (ibmcloud)\n  2. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in (ibmcloud ks)\n  3.
