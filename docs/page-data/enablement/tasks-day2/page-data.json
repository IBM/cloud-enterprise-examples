Day 1 focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Day 2 focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*. A good understanding of common Day 2 activities is a critical skill for cloud-native development teams.\n\nThese learning tasks are more advanced than those from the Day 1 Experience, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Re-read the Developer Guide| There have been updates from the first week.

For Day 1, you created your first app and CI pipeline, and then extended that into a 3-tier polyglot solution. For Day 2, you worked with your application's logs, monitored your app, and moved your code from *dev* to *test*.\n\nWhat is very clear is that the Developer Tools environment--an application architecture that combines a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster with powerful cloud services, packaged with a development environment with a CI/CD pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source tools--gives you a powerful development platform that enables you to build any form of cloud-native application. These skills form the foundation not only to develop applications for Kubernetes and OpenShift, but to develop applications that leverage the IBM Cloud Paks as well. \n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note**: Support is provided in the `#gsi-labs-enablement` Slack channel (in the [GSI Slack Org](https://gsicsi.slack.com/archives/CSRDJD5HA).

The GSI team is looking for feedback from three perspectives:\n\n- **What went well?**\n- **What needs improvement?**\n- **Next steps?**\n\nDevelopers will begin the learning journey with different skill levels and familiarity with this material, but will complete the Cloud Native enablement with a more detailed understanding of how to build solutions for the IBM Cloud. Each student's **Next Steps** will help identify that person's skill gaps to ensure they cover the topics needed to complete the learning journey successfully.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5e3a1e4f409260e7c659ffa2425e2d7e","counter":605,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 2 Developer Experience"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Day 2 Developer Experience\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nTasks for developers to understand how to monitor, log and manage deployments of applications\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have an IBM GSI Sandbox invite.
