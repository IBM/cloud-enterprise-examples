You should have received a Welcome email that provides the details of the IBM GSI Sandbox you've been assigned to and pointing you to this welcome page. By participating in this Cloud Native Learning Journey, you have access to:\n- The crafted education journey [Agenda](/enablement/agenda)\n- A RedHat OpenShift managed service cluster that has been pre-installed with the IBM Garage Cloud Native Toolkit and IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. \n - The development environment is pre-configured in a pay-as-you-go IBM Cloud account which you'll use to perform your learning tasks.\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** If you did not receive the Welcome email this will mean you may not have been given access to the IBM Cloud account. Please contact your GSI Business Development Executive.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Notification\n\nThe Welcome email gives you detail on how to access the development environment for team.\n\n**IBM GSI Sandbox Registration Details**\n- **Account**: This is the IBM Cloud account with a configured sandbox development environment, this will enable you to complete the learning agenda\n- **Team**: This is the name of your development team\n- **GitHub Organization**: This is the GitHub organization that will be used for storing your code during your learning activities\n- **Resource Group**: This is the IBM Cloud resource group where the development cluster and cloud resources have been provisioned.\n\nYou must associate your email address with your public GitHub account or make sure you have a public account that is using an email address that matches the one you have linked to your sandbox environment. \n\nTo set your email address in GitHub:\n- Go to [Github](https://github.com) (public, not enterprise)\n- Log into your account or create one\n- Navigate to you account settings\n- Select emails, check your IBM email address is your primary email for the account\n- If it is not, then add you IBM email and verify it\n- If you are correctly verified and associated, you will receive a second email inviting you to your team's GitHub organization\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** If you do not associate your business email with you public GitHub account, you will not receive\na Git Organization invite, and you will have issues completing the learning activities. IBM is not mixing personal email addresses with the business email that has been associated with your **GSI Sandbox**.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Sandbox\n\n[The Cloud Native Sandbox](/overview) is designed to make it easier for you to develop and deploy cloud-native applications. It includes an OpenShift cluster, cloud services bound to the cluster, and open source developer tools installed in the cluster. This combination supports developing cloud-native microservices architecture applications and CI/CD continuous deployment of those applications. \n\nThe Cloud Native Sandbox has been configured exactly how IBM recommends setting up a multi-tennat development team on the IBM Cloud. \n\nEach development team can contain up to **150+** developers. Each team has been configured in [IAM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam) with its own access group with a corresponding resource group. Your resources for your team's Developer Tools environment have been created in that resource group. As a member of your team's access group, you'll have access to the resources in your team's Developer Tools environment. You are restricted from creating new cloud resources or deleting existing ones.\n\nThe following diagram shows how access has been configured. Imagine you are the Green user: There will be a number of other users in your team accessing the same development cluster. You will all be sharing the same cloud resources. The Sandbox administrators will be monitoring the cluster to identify any issues early and resolve them.\n\n![MOOC Teams](devteams-master.png)\n\nYou will be given access to your team's GitHub organization will be expected to create all of your application source code into this organization. This is how real world development projects work. This enables you to collaborate with your fellow team members and prevents you from creating duplicate project names.\n\n## Team locations\n\nThe teams can be spread globally in different geographic locations listed below. IBM will try to make team membership as close to your home geographic as possible.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** After you receive your team notification email, please remember to accept your invitation join your team's GitHub organization.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\n| Team | Location | Region | Data Center | Git Org |\n| ---  | ------- | ------ | ---- | ----- |-------- |\n| **gsi-cloudnative-team** | London | eu-gb | lon06 | [GSI Enablement Code Repository](https://github.com/gsi-enablement-one) |\n\n![Team Locations](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/images/bluemix/data-centers/030-Data-Center-Maps_1-0.png)\n\n## Validating your access the IBM Cloud\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note**: If you have issues with any of the following steps, please raise an issue on the Slack channel **#gsi-labs-enablement** [Slack Channel](https://gsicsi.slack.com/archives/CSRDJD5HA).
