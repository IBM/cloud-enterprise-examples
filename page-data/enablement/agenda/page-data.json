Each section of learning includes mutliple hours of hands-on enablement activities. These are performed inside a fully enabled IBM Cloud Account containing all the Cloud Services you need to achieve success. \n\nIn order to complete the enablement activities, you must have access received an **IBM GSI Sandbox** invite email. A **IBM GSI Sandbox** includes a full managed instance of OpenShift and the corresponding **IBM Cloud Paks**, the cluster is also enabled with the accelerator asset from the [**IBM Garage for Cloud**](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/). The asset rapidly increases your time to success when developing cloud native application with IBM Cloud and RedHat OpenShift. \n\n## Goal\n\n> Ensure that GSI Ecosystem Partners are fully enabled \n> to support their client engagements and  co-creating \n> solutions based on Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks \n> that run on the IBM Cloud.\n> <cite>IBM GSI Ecosystem Team</cite>\n\nHow we will get there:\n- Recordings from IBM Cloud SME\n- Digital self-paced enablement to support your learning\n- Slack channels for SME support, knowledge sharing and networking\n\nUse the following Agenda to guide you through the self paced material.\n\n## Introduction \n\nThe introduction section has been designed to help you understand the key concepts of what building for Cloud Native means.

The fundamental learning path is understanding how \nto build RedHat OpenShift applications and manage them with DevOps. The IBM Garage for Cloud team has \ncreated a number of of open source assets that can be used to enable. The learning path will give you a good grounding in \nthe core fundamentals of cloud native application development on IBM Cloud with RedHat OpenShift.   \n\n**Desired outcomes:**\n- Understand how to approach Cloud Native Development with IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift\n- Use Day 1 developer experience to create your first OpenShift app that is managed with a CI Pipeline\n- Build a 3 tier microservice application that is fully deployed with Jenkins/CI and Argo/CD\n- Understand how Day 2 developer experience is managed with Logging, Monitoring, CD deployment\n- Understand how to Secure you applications end to end\n- Understand how to do coffee shop development with Code Ready Containers for learning and experimenting  on your local laptop\n\n_Requirements_:\n- Some understanding of **Java** and **NodeJS** is required\n- Some understanding of **Enterprise** class applications\n- Some understanding of **DevOps** pipelines \n\n| Topic                                                                                                                                            \t| Duration \t| Presenter                                   \t| Link                            \t|\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|----------\t|---------------------------------------------\t|---------------------------------\t|\n| Overview Enablement Content \t                            |    30mins   \t|                   | [Reading](/overview/content-overview)         \t|      \n| **Day 1 Developer Experience** Self Paced learning with IBM Cloud and RedHat OpenShift:                                                          \t|   8+hrs   \t| IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Guide        \t| [Tasks](/enablement/tasks-day1) \t|\n| **Day 2 Developer Experience** Self Paced learning with IBM Cloud and RedHat OpenShift                                                          \t| 8+hrs     \t|                                             \t| [Tasks](/enablement/tasks-day2)  \t|\n\n## Application Modernization \n\nClients have a historical backlog of applications that need to be modernized.
