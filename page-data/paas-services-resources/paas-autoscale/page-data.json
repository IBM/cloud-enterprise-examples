The types and levels of quotas depend on whether you're using the Lite, Standard, or Enterprise plan. Please refer link for more details -\nhttps://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-kafka_quotas#limits_enterprise.\n\n## Autoscaling for MongoDB  \n\nAutoscaling is designed to respond to the short-to-medium term trends in resource usage on your IBM® Cloud Databases for MongoDB deployment. Please refer link for more details - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-autoscaling.\n\n## Autoscaling for PostgreSql \n\nAutoscaling is designed to respond to the short-to-medium term trends in resource usage on your IBM® Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL deployment.

With  built-in  high-speed  file  transfer  capabilities,  cross-region  offerings,  and integrated  services,  IBM  Cloud  Object  Storage  can  help  you  securely  leverage  your  data.

It  does  not  follow  scale-up  and  scale-down  on  demand.  On  the backend IBM monitors the usage trends and buy additional capacity ahead of demand. So for a customer, it is limitless storage.
