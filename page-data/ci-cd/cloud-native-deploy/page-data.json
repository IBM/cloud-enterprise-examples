The instructions below\nwill show you how to do it.\n\nYou can create a new app using one of the [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](cloud-native-codepatterns). These have been\ncreated to include all the key components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you\nneed for your solutions. The approach for getting started is exactly the same for an environment based on\n**Kubernetes** or **Red Hat OpenShift**.\n\nThis video demonstrates how to work through the steps to create an application and use a deployment pipeline to install\nit into your development cluster.\n\n<Video src=\"/videos/deployapp.m4v\" type=\"video/m4v\" poster=\"/images/poster.png\"/>\n\n### Links\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"#1.-log-into-your-development-cluster-from-the-command-line\">1.

Log into your Development Cluster from the command line\n\n- This example will be using `kubectl` and is assuming **Kubernetes** cluster with Jenkins. You can us `oc` with and **OpenShift** cluster with the same set of commands.\n\n- Make sure you have installed all the [Prerequisite Dev Tools](/ci-cd/cloud-native-setup-tools) before continuing this includes the [Tools CLI](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/getting-started/cli)\n    - This will install a number of alias functions into `kubectl` and `oc` CLI tools including `sync`,`pipeline` and `endpoints`\n\n\n- Log in to the development cluster's CLI (Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift)\n\n    To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud console_, click on the **Access** tab, and follow the\n    instructions  in **After your cluster provisions, gain access**  section to log in to the cluster from the command line\n\n- You can test that you're connected to the cluster with the following simple command:\n\n  ```shell script\n  kubectl get pods -n tools\n  ```\n\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"info\">\n\n    **Note:** Most all of the remaining steps assume this step has already been performed. If you stop and then come\n    back later it is a good idea to re-run this step again before proceeding\n\n    </InlineNotification>\n\n### 2. Create the development namespace\n\n- Before getting started, the development namespace/project needs to be created and prepared for the DevOps pipelines.\n- This is something that would typically happen once at the beginning of a project as a development team is formed and assigned to the cluster.\n\n    ```\n    kubectl sync {DEV_NAMESPACE} --dev\n    ```\n\n### 3. Open the Developer Dashboard\n\nThe Developer Dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a\nsection that allows you to select a set of preconfigured [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/codepatterns/overview) that make seeding your development project very easy.\n\n\n- If you are logged into the OpenShift console you can select the tools menu and select **Developer Dashboard**\n\n- If you are logged into **Kubernetes** run the following command, this will open the Development Dashboard installed into the Kubernetes clusters.\n    ```bash\n    kubectl dashboard\n    ```\n\n- If you are on a laptop/desktop Open a browser and make sure you are logged into [Github](https://github.com)\n\n### 4. Create your app in Git\n\n- From the Developer Dashboard, click on **<Globals name=\"templates\" />** tab\n\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n    **Warning:** If you are developing on a shared education cluster, you need to make it easy to identify\n    your app. Please suffix the app name with your initials `{app name}-{your initials}` (e.g.\n    `stockbffnode-mjp`) and use the **Git Organization** for the shared environment.\n\n    **Warning:** Your browser needs to be logged in to your GitHub account for a template to work. If the link from the\n    tile displays the GitHub 404 page, log in and reload the page.\n\n    </InlineNotification>\n\n- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for your application and the language and framework that you prefer to work with. For your first application select the **Typescript Microservice**. This works well in the Cloud Shell as well.\n\n  Click on a <Globals name=\"template\" /> **Tile** to create your app github repository from the\n    template repository selected. You can also click on the **Git Icon** to browse the source template\n    repository and click on the **Template** to create the template\n\n- Complete the [GitHub create repository from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)\nprocess.\n\n  **Owner**: Select a valid GitHub organization that you are authorized to create repositories within or the one you were given for the shared cluster (See warning above)\n\n  **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo, GitHub will help with showing a green tick if it is valid (See warning above)\n\n  **Description**: Describe your app\n\n  Press **Create repository from template**\n\n  ![Template](/images/template.png)\n\n- The new repository will be created in your selected organization.\n\n### 5. Clone your code\n\n- Next, clone it to your local machine.\n- Click on **Clone or download**\n- Copy the clone _HTTPS link_, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your terminal.\n    ```shell script\n    git clone https://github.com/gsi-ecosystem-demo/stockbffnode-mjp.git\n    ```\n- You will be required to enter your **GitHub User ID** and use your **Git Hub Personal Access Token** as your password. This will complete the clone of your git repository.\n\n- Change into the cloned directory\n    ```shell script\n    cd stockbffnode-mjp\n    ```\n- You must rename the app to match your git repo or to a unique name for your solution. Then applications move into a _test_ environment they need to unique names.\n- Edit `package.json` and edit the `name:` field and change it from its template name to your chosen name.\n- Save the edits\n- Push the changes back to your repository\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"Update application name\"\n    git push\n    ```\n- You will be required to enter your **GitHub User ID** and use your **Git Hub Personal Access Token** as your password. This will push your changes back to the repository.\n\n## Running the Application\n\n### 6. Run the application\n\nMost developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally.\n\n- For the inside the folder for the code cloned from GitHub, run the following command to install the Node.js dependencies.\n    ```\n    npm install\n    ```\n- Then you can run the app from inside your cloud shell.\n    ```\n    npm run start\n    ```\n- To view the running app click on the **Eye Icon** on the top right and select the port `3000` this will open a browser tab and display the running app on that port.\n\n    ![View App](./images/viewapp.png)\n\n- You can try out the sample API that is provided with this **Code Pattern**\n\n- You can now add new features and function from inside the Cloud Shell and experiment with your code before you push you changes back to git.\n\n### 7. Set the namespace context\n\nBefore running these remainder of the instructions commands it is important to set the\nnamespace/project context. (**Notes:** The `kubernetes` command will work for both `openshift`\nand `kubernetes`.)\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n```shell script\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace={DEV_NAMESPACE}\n```\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n```shell script\noc project {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n```\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### 8. Register the App in a DevOps Pipeline\n\nUp to this point you have the code in a GitHub repository and have cloned it to you local development environment. You now need to register the repository with the continuous integration pipeline. The <Globals name=\"env\" /> supports both [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton) and [Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration) for continuous\nintegration.\n\n- Start the process to create a pipeline\n\n    ```shell script\n    kubectl pipeline\n    ```\n\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"info\">\n\n    The pipeline command give an option for both `Jenkins` and `Tekton`. For more information about working with the\n    different build engines, please see [Continuous Integration with Jenkins Guide](/guides/continuous-integration) and\n    [Continuous Integration with Tekton Guide](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)\n\n    </InlineNotification>\n\n- For the deployment of your first app with Kubenetes select **Jenkins** as the chosen CI engine. If you are developing on OpenShift 4.3 select **Tekton** for your CI engine.\n\n- The first time a pipeline is registered in the namespace, the CLI will ask for a username and\n**Personal Access Token** for the Git repository that will be stored in a secret named `git-credentials`. It will also ask for the branch that should be used for the pipeline.\n\n  - **Username**: Enter your GitHub user id\n  - **Personal Access Token**: Paste your GitHub personal access token\n  - **Branch**: Press enter for the default git branch or type in another branch you want to register\n\n    ```bash\n    $ kubectl pipeline\n    ? Select the type of pipeline that should be run? Jenkins\n    Creating pipeline on kubernetes cluster in dev-mjp namespace\n    Creating secret(s) with git credentials\n      Project git repo: https://github.com/mjperrins/stockbffnode-mjp.git\n    ? Provide the git username: <userid>\n    ? Provide the git personal access token: [hidden]\n    ? Provide the git branch that should be used: master\n    Setting up Jenkins environment\n    Copying Jenkins credentials\n    Registering pipeline: mjperrins.stockbffnode-mjp\n    admin via ibm-garage-cloud cli\n    Creating git webhook\n    Creating webhook to url:  https://jenkins.gsi-dev-iks-116-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/github-webhook/\n    ```\n- When using **Jenkins** pipeline the `kubectl pipeline` command will complete with the setup and registration of a webhook.\n\n    **Note:** if the webhook registration step fails it is likely because the Git credentials are incorrect or do not have enough permission in the repository or you have register a WebHook already\n\n- When registering a **Tekton** pipeline, you will be prompted to select which pipeline you want to use for your application. If you selected Node based Code Pattern select the Node pipeline. If you selected Java select the Gradle pipeline.\n- For the first app select the `igc-nodejs-v1.x.0` version of the pipeline. This will use the Node based CI pipeline with Tekton.\n    ```\n    ? Select the Pipeline to use in the PipelineRun: (Use arrow keys)❯\n     igc-appmod-liberty-v1-2-0\n     igc-java-gradle-v1-2-0\n     igc-java-maven-v1-2-0\n     igc-nodejs-v1-2-0\n     Skip PipelineRun creation\n    ```\n\n- The pipeline will be registered in your development cluster.\n\n### 9. View your application pipeline\n\nThe steps to view your registered pipeline will vary based on type of pipeline (`Jenkins` or `Tekton`) and container\nplatform version (`IKS`, `OCP 3.11`, or `OCP 4.3`).\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes Jenkins \">\n\n1. Run the command `kubectl dashboard` in your terminal to open your Developer Dashboard.\n2. Select the Jenkins tool to open the Jenkins dashboard\n3. Run the command `kubectl credentials` in your terminal to get the list of logins for the tools\n4. Use the Jenkins userid and password to log into the Jenkins dashboard\n\nWait for the pipeline stages to start building. Once the stages have completed, you will see a view similar to the one below.\n\n![Jenkins Pipeline](images/pipeline.png)\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3 Tekton\">\n\n- Open the OpenShift Web Console from the Developer Cluster instance\n\n    ![OpenShift](images/openshiftconsole.png)\n\n- From menu on the left switch to the **Developer** mode\n\n- Select _dev_ project that was used for the application pipeline registration\n\n- In the left menu, select *Pipelines*\n\n- You will see your application dev ops pipeline now starting to build and once completed will look like the image below.\n\n    ![OpenShift](images/tektonpipeline.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3 Jenkins\">\n\n1.

Select your project from the drop-down menu at the top\n\n4. The registered pipeline should appear in the list\n\n</Tab>\n\n\n</Tabs>\n\n### 10. Access the running app\n\nOnce the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the namespace used when\nregistering the pipeline. To validate the app is running follow these steps:\n\n**Note:** Be sure the namespace context is set correctly before running the following commands -\n[set the namespace context](#7.-set-the-namespace-context)\n\n- Retrieve the app ingress endpoint using commands below in your terminal.\n\n    ```bash\n    kubectl endpoints\n    ```\n\n- From the endpoints listed, select the URL for the repo that was just deployed and press **Enter** to\nopen that URL in a web browser and validate the application is working as expected\n\n### 11. Locate the app in the web console\n\nThe build pipeline is configured to build the source code from the Git repository into a container image. This\nimage is stored in the [Image Registry](/guides/image-registry). After that the image is deployed into the\nsame namespace/project within development cluster where the pipeline ran and validated for its health. The steps\nbelow will walk through locating the installed application within the Web Console.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n- Open the **Kubernetes Dashboard**\n- Change to the namespace from `default` to either `dev` or the namespace you used to deploy your app\n- Click on **Deployments**\n- You should see the deployment of your application\n- Click on your application , and the corresponding **Replica Set**\n- Try scaling the application, click on **Scale** in the header, change number of pods to 2 and click **OK**\n- Click on one of the `pod` instances\n- Click on **Logs**\n- You can see the running state of your application\n- Navigate around the console to understand where your deployment, service and pods are running\n\n![Pods on IKS](images/podsiks.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3\">\n\n- Open the **OpenShift web console**\n- Change to the **Developer** view\n- Click on **Topology** menu\n- Click on your application deployment in the topology view\n- Click on on the **Overview** tab\n- Increase the number of running pods\n- Click **Resource** tab and then on the pod **View Logs** link\n- You can see the running state of your application\n\n![Pods on OpenShift](images/topology.png)\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 3.11\">\n\n- Open the **OpenShift web console**\n- Change to the **Application Console**\n- Select you project either `dev` or the namespace you used to deploy your app\n- Click on **Deployments**\n- You should see the deployment of your application\n- Click on your application, and the corresponding deployment number\n- Try increasing the number of pods to see new instances being provisioned\n- Click on one of the `pod` instances\n- Click on **Logs**\n- You can see the running state of your application\n-.

Provide the git branch that should be used: master\n    Setting up Jenkins environment\n    Copying Jenkins credentials\n    Registering pipeline: mjperrins.stockbffnode-mjp\n    admin via ibm-garage-cloud cli\n    Creating git webhook\n    Creating webhook to url:  https://jenkins.gsi-dev-iks-116-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/github-webhook/\n    ```\n- When using **Jenkins** pipeline the `kubectl pipeline` command will complete with the setup and registration of a webhook.\n\n    **Note:** if the webhook registration step fails it is likely because the Git credentials are incorrect or do not have enough permission in the repository or you have register a WebHook already\n\n- When registering a **Tekton** pipeline, you will be prompted to select which pipeline you want to use for your application. If you selected Node based Code Pattern select the Node pipeline. If you selected Java select the Gradle pipeline.\n- For the first app select the `igc-nodejs-v1.x.0` version of the pipeline. This will use the Node based CI pipeline with Tekton.\n    ```\n    ? Select the Pipeline to use in the PipelineRun: (Use arrow keys)❯\n     igc-appmod-liberty-v1-2-0\n     igc-java-gradle-v1-2-0\n     igc-java-maven-v1-2-0\n     igc-nodejs-v1-2-0\n     Skip PipelineRun creation\n    ```\n\n- The pipeline will be registered in your development cluster.\n\n### 9. View your application pipeline\n\nThe steps to view your registered pipeline will vary based on type of pipeline (`Jenkins` or `Tekton`) and container\nplatform version (`IKS`, `OCP 3.11`, or `OCP 4.3`).\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes Jenkins \">\n\n1. Run the command `kubectl dashboard` in your terminal to open your Developer Dashboard.\n2. Select the Jenkins tool to open the Jenkins dashboard\n3. Run the command `kubectl credentials` in your terminal to get the list of logins for the tools\n4. Use the Jenkins userid and password to log into the Jenkins dashboard\n\nWait for the pipeline stages to start building. Once the stages have completed, you will see a view similar to the one below.\n\n![Jenkins Pipeline](images/pipeline.png)\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3 Tekton\">\n\n- Open the OpenShift Web Console from the Developer Cluster instance\n\n    ![OpenShift](images/openshiftconsole.png)\n\n- From menu on the left switch to the **Developer** mode\n\n- Select _dev_ project that was used for the application pipeline registration\n\n- In the left menu, select *Pipelines*\n\n- You will see your application dev ops pipeline now starting to build and once completed will look like the image below.\n\n    ![OpenShift](images/tektonpipeline.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3 Jenkins\">\n\n1. Open the OpenShift Web Console from the Developer Cluster instance\n\n    ![OpenShift](images/openshiftconsole.png)\n\n2. From the left-hand menu, select `Builds` -> `Build Configs`\n\n3. Select your project from the drop-down menu at the top\n\n4. The registered pipeline should appear in the list\n\n</Tab>\n\n\n</Tabs>\n\n### 10. Access the running app\n\nOnce the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the namespace used when\nregistering the pipeline. To validate the app is running follow these steps:\n\n**Note:** Be sure the namespace context is set correctly before running the following commands -\n[set the namespace context](#7.-set-the-namespace-context)\n\n- Retrieve the app ingress endpoint using commands below in your terminal.\n\n    ```bash\n    kubectl endpoints\n    ```\n\n- From the endpoints listed, select the URL for the repo that was just deployed and press **Enter** to\nopen that URL in a web browser and validate the application is working as expected\n\n### 11. Locate the app in the web console\n\nThe build pipeline is configured to build the source code from the Git repository into a container image. This\nimage is stored in the [Image Registry](/guides/image-registry). After that the image is deployed into the\nsame namespace/project within development cluster where the pipeline ran and validated for its health. The steps\nbelow will walk through locating the installed application within the Web Console.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n- Open the **Kubernetes Dashboard**\n- Change to the namespace from `default` to either `dev` or the namespace you used to deploy your app\n- Click on **Deployments**\n- You should see the deployment of your application\n- Click on your application , and the corresponding **Replica Set**\n- Try scaling the application, click on **Scale** in the header, change number of pods to 2 and click **OK**\n- Click on one of the `pod` instances\n- Click on **Logs**\n- You can see the running state of your application\n- Navigate around the console to understand where your deployment, service and pods are running\n\n![Pods on IKS](images/podsiks.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.3\">\n\n- Open the **OpenShift web console**\n- Change to the **Developer** view\n- Click on **Topology** menu\n- Click on your application deployment in the topology view\n- Click on on the **Overview** tab\n- Increase the number of running pods\n- Click **Resource** tab and then on the pod **View Logs** link\n- You can see the running state of your application\n\n![Pods on OpenShift](images/topology.png)\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 3.11\">\n\n- Open the **OpenShift web console**\n- Change to the **Application Console**\n- Select you project either `dev` or the namespace you used to deploy your app\n- Click on **Deployments**\n- You should see the deployment of your application\n- Click on your application, and the corresponding deployment number\n- Try increasing the number of pods to see new instances being provisioned\n- Click on one of the `pod` instances\n- Click on **Logs**\n- You can see the running state of your application\n-.
