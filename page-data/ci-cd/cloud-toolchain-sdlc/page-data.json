Jobs and Stages to easily handle any type of testing such as running unit tests, \nfunctional tests, or to integrate with testing tools such as SonarQuber. \nPipeline Stages should be applied to any step within the SDLC model, whether it is building, testing or deployment related.\n\nThe pipeline also provides you with tracability. \nEach execution of a stage records a trigger source and, at the start of the pipeline, a specific code commit, so that you can trace each pipeline execution back to a single change in the code.\n\n\n## IBM Devops Insights\n\nOne testing tool that is provided native on IBM Cloud to help multiple testing scenarios is Devops Insights.\nIBM Cloud DevOps Insights is a tool that aggregates code, test, build, and deployment data to provide visibility of quality for all of your teams.\nWith DevOps Insights, you can maintain and improve the quality of your code in IBM Cloud. \nYou can monitor your deployments to identify risks before they are released, analyze development changes for error probability, and improve the interactions of your team.\n\nFollow [this tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-di_working) for a
