This automation can be tailored to the specific project requirements.\n\nYou can read more information about Jenkins Pipelines [here](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)\n\n### Stages\n\nPipelines are defined in a `Jenkinsfile` that sits in the root of your application code. It defines a number of stages. Each of the [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/codepatterns/overview) includes a `Jenkinsfile` that offers a number of stages. The stages have been configured to complete the build, test, package, and deploy of the application code. Each stage can use the defined defined `secrets` and `config maps` that were previously configured during the installation of Development cluster setup.\n\n## Developer Tools Pipeline\n\nTo enable application compatibility between Kubernetes and OpenShift, the `Jenkinsfile` is consistent between pipeline registration with\nboth platforms. Also, the Docker images are built from\n[UBI images](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)\nso that their containers can run on both platforms.\n\nThese are the stages in the pipeline and a description of what each stage does. The **bold stage names** indicate\nthe stages that are required; the ***italics stage names*** indicate optional stages that can be deleted or will be ignored if the tool\nsupporting the stage is not installed. These stages represent a typical production pipeline flow for a cloud-native application.\n- **Setup**: Clones the code into the pipeline\n- **Build**: Runs the build commands for the code\n- **Test**:\tValidates the unit tests for the code\n- ***Publish pacts***:\tPublishes any pact contracts that have been defined\n- ***Sonar scan***: Runs a sonar code scan of the source code and publishes the results to SonarQube\n- **Verify environment**: Validates the OpenShift or IKS environment configuration is valid\n- **Build image**: Builds the code into a Docker images and stores it in the IBM Cloud Image registry\n- **Deploy to DEV env**:\tDeploys the Docker image tagged version to `dev` namespace using Helm Chart\n- **Health Check**: Validates the Health Endpoint of the deployed application\n- ***Package Helm Chart***: Stores the tagged version of the Helm chart in Artifactory\n- ***Trigger CD Pipeline***: This is a GitOps stage that will update the build number in designated git repo and trigger ArgoCD for deployment to **test**\n\n## Registering Pipelines\n\n- The [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/ci-cd/cloud-native-codepatterns) are a good place to start to see how `Jenkinsfile` and `Dockerfile` should be configured for use in a Jenkins CI pipeline. To register your git repo, use the CLI. The CLI tools adds a new command called `kubectl pipeline`, This command automates a number of manual steps you would have to do with Jenkins, including: managing secrets, webhooks, and pipeline registration in the Jenkins tools.\n\n- By default, the pipeline will register into the current namespace and will copy all the `configMaps` and `secrets` from the `tools` namespace to this namespace. This means the pipeline can execute, knowing it has access to the key information that enables it to integrate with both the cloud platform and the various development tools.\n\n### Registering Pipeline in new namespace\n\n- You can use any namespace you want to register a pipeline. Using the `kubcectl sync` command it will created you a new namespace for your team. It will copy the necessary `secrets` and `configMaps` into that namespace and configure the build agents pods to run in that namespace.\n    ```bash\n    kubectl sync dev-team-one --dev\n    ```\n- You can structure multi teams squads, teams, pairs or students working in the same Development cluster given them their own namespace to work in for CI activities.\n\n- Create a template app and clone it to your Cloud Shell environment\n- Then register the code with the Jenkins environment using the following command\n    ```bash\n    kubectl pipeline\n    ```\n- You will be prompted for you Git Hub Personal Access token\n\n- It will complete with the registration of the application code in a Jenkins pipeline\n\n## Continuous deployment\n\nIn addition to continuous integration, the <Globals name=\"env\" /> also supports continuous delivery\nusing Artifactory and ArgoCD.\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"What is Tekton\">\n\n## What is Tekton\n\nTekton is a new emerging CI tool that has been built to support Kubernetes and OpenShift from the ground up.\n\n[Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. It lets you build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.\n\n### Tekton 101\n\n<iframe width=\"80%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWxKD9dLpmk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nTekton provides open-source components to help you standardize your CI/CD tooling and processes across vendors, languages, and deployment environments. Industry specifications around pipelines, releases, workflows, and other CI/CD components available with Tekton will work well with existing CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, Jenkins X, Skaffold, and Knative, among others.\n\n- Read the this this [Overview of Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton-crc#what-is-tekton)\n\n- For more information read up about it [Tekton Tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/knative-build-app-development-with-tekton/)\n\n- For more information read up about it [App Build Tutorial with Tekton](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/knative-build-app-development-with-tekton/)\n\nThe IBM Cloud is standardizing on using Tekton in both IBM Cloud DevOps\n service and IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. OpenShift 4.x will also natively\n  support it.\n\nThis guide will focus on using Tekton when the Development tools have been\n installed in Red Hat OpenShift, IBM Kubernetes Managed services and **Red Hat\n  Code Ready Containers** to give you choice for you Continuous Integration\n   cloud native development toolset.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This guide will help you set up the [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/codepatterns/overview) with  **Tekton** and requires that you have installed Tekton with **Red Hat Code Ready Containers 4.2** or have installed open source Tekton into the The IBM Kubernetes Cluster.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Common App Tasks\n\nThe following gives a description of each `Task` that is commonly used in a\n `Pipeline`.

You can now configure your applications to be built, packaged, tested and deployed to your OpenShift or Kubernetes development cluster.\n\n- Create to the pipeline.  for details about how the `pipeline` command works.)\n\n    ```bash\n    oc pipeline\n    ```\n\n### Verify the pipeline\n\nTo validate your pipeline have been correctly configured, and has triggered a\n `PipelineRun`\n use the following **Tekton** dashboards or `tkn` CLI to validate it ran\n  correctly without errors.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift 4.x\">\n\n- Review you **Pipeline** in the OpenShift 4.x Console\n\n    ![Pipelinerun](./images/pipeline.png)\n\n- Review your **Tasks**\n\n    ![Tasks](./images/tasks.png)\n\n- Review your **Steps**\n\n    ![Steps](./images/steps.png)\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Opensource Tekton Dashboard\">\n\nIf you are running Tekton with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications or Knative with\n Kubernetes managed service your dashboard view will look similar to below.\n\n- Review your **Pipeline**\n\n    ![PipelineRun](./images/pipeline-os.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Tekton CLI\">\n\nIf you are running **Tekton** with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications or Knative\n with Kubernetes managed service your dashboard view will look similar to below.\n\n- Review your **Pipeline**\n    ```bash\n    tkn pipelinerun list\n    ```\n- Review **Pipeline** details\n    ```bash\n    tkn pipelinerun describe {pipeline-name}\n    ```\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n### Running Application\n\nOnce the **Jenkins** or **Tekton** pipeline has successfully completed you can validate your\n app has been successfully deployed.\n\n- Open the Kubernetes Dashboard or OpenShift Console and select the {new-namespace} project\n\n- Get the hostname for the application from ingress\n    ```bash\n    kubectl endpoints -n {new-namespace}\n    ```\n- You can use the the `oc` command to get the name of the deployed application\n    ```bash\n    oc endpoints -n {new-project}\n    ```\n\n- Use the application URL to open it your browser for testing\n\n- For more information read the [Pipeline Test Instructions](cloud-native-deploy)\n\nOnce you become familiar with deploying code into OpenShift using **Tekton**, read up about how you can manage code deployment with **Continuous Delivery** with [ArgoCD and Artifactory](cloud-native-cd)\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/johandry/Workspace/ibm/att-cloudnative/ibmcloud-pattern-guide/src/pages/ci-cd/cloud-native-ci-tools/index.mdx"}}}}
